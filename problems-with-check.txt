Problems with check
===================

(Mind, I'm very greatful for it! It's still wonderful it (a) exists, and (b)
uses forking to make it possible to handle segmentation faults, etc, - this is
a fundamental requirement to my mind. And the list of *good things* about
check would be a LOT longer.)

1. LGPL, which I'd prefer otherwise. This is a very minor problem, really.

2  Also, really would prefer to be in an autotools environment, which is not
   what I want to set up.

   This is *very much* the sort of thing the author of a project should
   decide, and the check author has done so (and since it works on many
   Unices, it's probably a Good Thing).

3. Doesn't/can't mix test name, test output and test result - I'd like to see
   them all in one stream.

   (Some of this can be achieved by editing a local version of check.h, but
   it's not perfect without making more intrusive changes).

4. Many more macros for comparison would be useful.

   Of course, I could write them...

.. vim: set filetype=rst tabstop=8 softtabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab:
